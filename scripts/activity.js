window.onload = function() {



	// 1. Change the color of the box to blue.

	$("#one").css("background-color", "blue");



	// 2.  Change the text to, "Well, more of a rectangle, really!".





	// 3. Increase the width to 300px to let the little block be more expressive. 






	// 4. Increase the nerdy block's font by 4px.
	// Hint: You need to remove "px", add the value, and add "px" back.
	// Hint: parseInt() might help you...






	// 5. On a click, banish the smart-aleck block by slowly, intimately, fading it out of existence.







	// 6. Implement the two button's respective functions.











	// 7. Move the block right when mousing over. 
	// Challenge: Can you move it back when repeated?
	// Hint: How can you keep track of whether it's left or not? 
	// Or, whether it's TRUE or FALSE that it's been moved?
















	// 8. Challenge: Change the block's color whenever you press DOWN on a KEY.
	// Hint: Use this to change the index each time: `index = (index + 1) % colors.length`

	colors = ["orange", "green", "blue", "purple", "red"]
	index = 0
